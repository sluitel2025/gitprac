    # Starting with PA4, we will implement common ML algorithms
    # following the style of popular libraries (like scikit-learn or TensorFlow,etc.) API
    # API = Application Programming Interface
    # Reference: https://scikit-learn.org/1.3/tutorial/statistical_inference/supervised_learning.html

    # X: 2D feature matrix (rows = instances, columns = attributes)
    # y: 1D target vector (values we want to predict)
    # Note: y is stored separately from X

    # Typical workflow:
    # 1. Split X and y into training and testing sets
    # 2. Train the model using the training set (X_train, y_train)
    # 3. Evaluate the model using the testing set (X_test, y_test)
    # Note: X_train aligns with y_train, X_test aligns with y_test


    # Each algorithm is implemented as a class with two main methods:
    # - fit(X_train, y_train): trains the model on the training data
    # - predict(X_test): returns predictions (y_pred) for the test data
    #   y_pred is aligned with y_test

    # Model evaluation:
    # - Regression: e.g.,Mean Squared Error (MSE) Mean Absolute Error (MAE) — average of absolute differences
    # - Classification: e.g., Accuracy — proportion of correct predictions
